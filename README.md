# Hyva
Hyvä Themes introduces a modern Magento frontend, designed from the ground up using the familiar Magento templating system. It retains the tools that Magento developers appreciate—layout XML, blocks, view models, and PHTML—while eliminating the more cumbersome aspects such as UI-components, Knockout, RequireJS, and LESS CSS.
